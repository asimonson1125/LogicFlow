# Which Programming Language Should I Start Learning?

# If you like a STEM subject, and you have decided that you want to connect your career with IT, you need to know which of the programming languages will help you in your work. Most likely, you will start learning the programming language with Python.

# Python is one of the simplest programming languages that is becoming more popular in the IT world. Python ranks fourth in popularity among programming languages, second only to the classic Java, C, and C ++. Today, every programmer must own this tool to be successful in his niche.

# Python is a multipurpose programming language that allows programmers to write code that reads well. The relative conciseness of Python allows you to create a program that will be much shorter than its counterpart written in another language.
